Installation
------------

After cloning this repository, you need to initialize submodules:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

and then install the configuration files:

    $ ./install.py

This command will create symbolic links in $HOME pointing to the configuration
files.

If upstream changes were made on the submoduled projects, you can pull the
changes by:

    $ ./update-submodules.sh
