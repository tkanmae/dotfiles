# Installation

After cloning this repository, you need to initialize submodules:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

and then install the configuration files:

    $ ./install.py

This command creates symbolic links in $HOME pointing to the configuration
files.


# Updating submodules

If upstream changes were made on the submoduled projects, you can pull the
changes by

    $ git submodule foreach --recursive 'git pull origin master'
